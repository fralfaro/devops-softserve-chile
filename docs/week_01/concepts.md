# Basic Concepts

## Software Development Concepts
1. **Framework**  
   A framework is a pre-built structure or foundation that provides reusable code and tools to facilitate software development. It defines a standard way to build and deploy applications, including libraries, APIs, and best practices. Examples include Django (Python), React (JavaScript), and Spring (Java).

2. **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)**  
   SDLC is a structured process that guides the development of software from planning to deployment and maintenance. It typically includes stages such as planning, analysis, design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance.

3. **eXtreme Programming (XP)**  
   XP is an agile software development methodology that emphasizes frequent releases, continuous feedback, and collaboration between developers and customers. It promotes practices like test-driven development (TDD), pair programming, and continuous integration.

4. **SCRUM**  
   SCRUM is an agile project management framework used for developing software in iterative cycles called sprints (usually 1-4 weeks). It involves roles like the Product Owner, Scrum Master, and Development Team, and uses ceremonies such as daily stand-ups, sprint planning, and retrospectives.

5. **Kanban**  
   Kanban is a lean project management methodology that focuses on visualizing work, limiting work in progress (WIP), and improving workflow efficiency. It uses a board with columns (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Done) to track tasks.

6. **Native / Hybrid Mobile Applications**  
   - **Native applications**: Apps built specifically for a particular mobile platform (iOS or Android) using platform-specific languages (Swift for iOS, Kotlin/Java for Android). They offer high performance and access to native device features.  
  
  
   - **Hybrid applications**: Apps that combine web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) with a native wrapper to run on multiple platforms. They use frameworks like Ionic or React Native and are easier to maintain than native apps.

## General Software Concepts

7. **Software**  
   Software is a collection of programs, instructions, and data that enable a computer to perform specific tasks. It is divided into **system software** (like operating systems) and **application software** (like Microsoft Word or Google Chrome).

8. **Operating System (OS)**  
   An OS is system software that manages computer hardware and software resources while providing a user interface. Examples include Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, and iOS.

9. **Application**  
   An application (app) is software designed to perform specific tasks for users, such as word processing, web browsing, or email. Applications can be desktop-based, web-based, or mobile-based.

10. **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)**  
    CRUD represents the four basic operations performed on data in a database or system:

    - **Create**: Add new records or data.
    - **Read**: Retrieve existing data.
    - **Update**: Modify existing data.
    - **Delete**: Remove existing data.

## Cloud Computing Models

11. **Software as a Service (SaaS)**  
    A cloud computing model where users access software applications over the internet without installing them on their devices. Examples: Gmail, Dropbox, Microsoft 365.

12. **Platform as a Service (PaaS)**  
    A cloud computing model that provides a platform for developers to build, test, and deploy applications without managing infrastructure. Examples: Google App Engine, AWS Elastic Beanstalk.

13. **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**  
    A cloud computing model that provides virtualized computing resources over the internet, such as servers, storage, and networking. Users have more control over the infrastructure. Examples: AWS EC2, Microsoft Azure Virtual Machines.
