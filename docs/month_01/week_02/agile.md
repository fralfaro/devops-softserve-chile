# **Agile, Scrum, and Kanban**

## **Introduction**
This document covers key aspects of Agile methodologies, focusing on **Scrum** and **Kanban**. It also discusses the **Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)** and its application in **DevOps**.



## **Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)**
- The **Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)** is a process for building software systems in a structured way.
- It consists of multiple phases:
  - **Planning**
  - **Analysis**
  - **Design**
  - **Development**
  - **Testing**
  - **Deployment**
  - **Operations & Maintenance**
- SDLC can be implemented using different methodologies.

### **SDLC in DevOps**
- DevOps integrates SDLC with automation and continuous delivery practices.

## **Project Management in Software Development**
- Project management involves **leading a team** to meet specific project goals under given constraints (time, budget, scope).
- Various software project management methodologies exist:
  - **Waterfall**
  - **Spiral (RUP and others)**
  - **V-Model**
  - **eXtreme Programming (XP)**
  - **Agile (Scrum, Kanban, etc.)**
- Agile methodologies have gained popularity due to their adaptability and iterative approach.



## **Agile Methodology**
Agile is based on the **Agile Manifesto**, which prioritizes:
- **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools.
- **Working software** over comprehensive documentation.
- **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation.
- **Responding to change** over following a plan.

### **Scrum vs. Kanban**
- **Scrum** is a structured framework for iterative software development.
- **Kanban** is a lean workflow management method, suitable for **continuous delivery** and incremental improvements.



## **Kanban**
### **What is Kanban?**
- A lean methodology that originated from the **Toyota Production System (TPS)**.
- Designed for **continuous workflow improvement** in Agile and DevOps teams.

### **Key Kanban Practices**
1. **Visualizing workflow** (via a **Kanban board**).
2. **Limiting work in progress (WIP)**.
3. **Managing flow** efficiently.
4. **Making process policies explicit**.
5. **Implementing feedback loops**.
6. **Improving collaboratively**.

### **Kanban Board**
- A visual tool that tracks work items from **To Do** → **In Progress** → **Done**.



## **Scrum**
### **What is Scrum?**
- A framework for managing **complex product development**.
- Introduced by **Hirotaka Takeuchi and Ikujiro Nonaka (1986)**.
- Formalized by **Ken Schwaber and Jeff Sutherland (1995)**.
- Standardized in the **Scrum Guide (2009)**.

### **Scrum Pillars**
1. **Transparency** – Everyone understands the work process.
2. **Inspection** – Regularly assess progress.
3. **Adaptation** – Adjust plans based on feedback.

### **Scrum Values**
- **Commitment**
- **Focus**
- **Openness**
- **Respect**
- **Courage**

### **Scrum Key Elements**
- **Roles**
- **Events**
- **Artifacts**



## **Scrum Roles**
1. **Developers**
   - Build the software.
   - Maintain the **Sprint Backlog**.
   - Ensure adherence to the **Definition of Done**.
  
2. **Product Owner (PO)**
   - Maximizes product value.
   - Manages the **Product Backlog**.
   - Represents stakeholders.
  
3. **Scrum Master**
   - Ensures effective Scrum adoption.
   - Coaches the team on Agile principles.
   - Serves the **Product Owner**, **Developers**, and **Organization**.



## **Scrum Events**
### **Sprint**
- A **time-boxed iteration** (1 month or less) for development.
- Enables **predictability and adaptability**.

### **Sprint Planning**
- Defines the work for the sprint.
- Covers:
  1. Why is this Sprint valuable?
  2. What can be done this Sprint?
  3. How will the work be accomplished?
- Common estimation techniques:
  - **Planning Poker**
  - **T-Shirt Sizes**
  - **Bucket System**

### **Daily Scrum (Daily Stand-up)**
- **15-minute daily meeting**.
- Focuses on:
  1. What was completed yesterday?
  2. What will be done today?
  3. Are there any blockers?

### **Sprint Review**
- **Second to last event of the sprint**.
- Demonstrates progress to stakeholders.
- Determines next steps.

### **Sprint Retrospective**
- **Final event of the sprint**.
- Focuses on **team improvement** and workflow enhancements.

### **Event Time-Boxes**
| Event | 30 days | 3 weeks | 2 weeks | 1 week |
|--|--|--|--|--|
| Sprint Planning | 8 hrs | <8 hrs | <8 hrs | <4 hrs |
| Daily Scrum | 15 min | 15 min | 15 min | 15 min |
| Sprint Review | 4 hrs | <4 hrs | <4 hrs | <2 hrs |
| Sprint Retrospective | 3 hrs | <3 hrs | <3 hrs | <1.5 hrs |



## **Scrum Artifacts**
### **Product Backlog**
- An **ordered list** of all necessary features and tasks.
- Maintained by the **Product Owner**.

### **Sprint Backlog**
- Contains:
  - **Sprint Goal** (why).
  - **Selected Product Backlog Items** (what).
  - **Actionable plan** (how).
- Maintained by **Developers**.

### **Product Backlog Items (PBIs)**
- Includes:
  - **User Stories**
  - **Feature Definitions**
  - **Non-functional Requirements**
  - **Constraints & Bugs**

### **User Stories**
- Short descriptions of user needs:
  ```
  As a [role], I want [goal], so that [benefit].
  ```

### **Increment**
- A **working piece of the product** that delivers value.
- Must be **usable** and meet the **Definition of Done**.

### **Definition of Done (DoD)**
- Establishes quality standards.
- Ensures that completed work is **shippable**.



## **Scrum with Remote Teams**
- Remote work presents challenges such as:
  - Communication gaps.
  - Different time zones.
  - Feeling of isolation.
  - Knowledge fragmentation.

### **Best Practices**
- **Clear communication plan**.
- **Effective collaboration tools** (e.g., Slack, Jira).
- **Daily stand-ups** to keep teams aligned.
- **Well-defined Product Backlog**.
- **Encourage self-organization**.
