## **Jira Overview**  
Jira is a flexible project management tool that allows customization of workflows, integration with existing systems, and the addition of plugins. It is commonly used for:  

- Bug tracking for a single application  
- Managing software development across multiple products  
- Running multiple projects within a company  

### **Jira Terminology**
- **Project**: A collection of issues, each identified by a name and key.  
- **Issue**: Represents different entities depending on the organization, such as a software bug, project task, helpdesk ticket, or product improvement.  

### **Jira Components and Versions**  
- **Components**: Subsections of a project used to group issues into smaller parts.  
- **Versions**: Points-in-time in a project, used for release planning (e.g., application builds, sprints). Versions can have different statuses: Released, Unreleased, Archived, or Overdue.  

### **Jira Issues and Types**  
Jira issues represent logical pieces of a project's scope. There are two types of issues: **parent** and **child (sub-issues)**. Each issue follows a workflow with different states and transitions.  

- **Epic & Story**: Describe project scope within requirements management.  
- **Task & Technical Task**: Represent generic project work, with technical tasks often related to specific functionalities.  
- **Bug & Sub-Bug**: Describe problems affecting functionality, supporting Agile best practices.  
- **Improvement, New Feature & Risk**: Used for documenting changes, feature requests, and risk analysis.  

### **Jira Workflow**  
Issues move through different **statuses** (e.g., Open, In Progress, Resolved, Closed) via **transitions** (e.g., Start Progress, Resolve, Reopen).  

### **Filtering and Dashboards**  
- **Simple Search**: Basic issue search.  
- **Advanced Search (JQL - Jira Query Language)**: SQL-like queries for complex filtering.  
- **Quick Search**: Fast issue lookup with minimal typing.  
- **Issue Filters**: Saved searches that can be displayed in dashboards and shared with others.  
- **Dashboards**: Provide visual information using **gadgets**, which display charts, reports, and team collaboration tools.
